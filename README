The default vim behavour when switching to an open buffer is to scroll the window so the cursor will be positioned at the window's center.

This script remembers the cursor position relative to the window for every visited buffer and restores it (makes proper scrolling) when switched back to the buffer.

For more pleasure you can ":set nostartofline" option.
